🔁 Steps in SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis
👉 In this phase, business analysts and stakeholders gather all the business needs.
	* Understand what the client wants.
	* Document functional and non-functional requirements.
	* Create Requirement Specification documents (like BRD, SRS).

2. Planning
👉 This phase involves defining the scope, timelines, and resources.
	* Create a project plan.
	* Risk analysis and mitigation planning.
	* Define roles and responsibilities.

3. Design
👉 Based on the requirements, technical architects and designers create the system architecture.
	* High-Level Design (HLD): System architecture, tech stack.
	* Low-Level Design (LLD): Component-level design, UI mockups.

4. Development (Implementation)
👉 Developers start coding the software according to the design documents.
	* Frontend and backend development.
	* Code review and unit testing.

5. Testing
👉 QA (Quality Assurance) team tests the application to ensure it meets the requirements.
	* Types of testing: Functional, Regression, Integration, System, UAT, etc.
	* Bug reporting and re-testing.

6. Deployment
👉 The tested application is deployed to a production/live environment.
	* Done in phases or full release.
	* May involve staging/pre-production environments first.

7. Maintenance & Support
👉 After release, the product is monitored, bugs are fixed, and updates are applied as needed.
	* Handle user feedback and support.
	* Apply patches and upgrades.
