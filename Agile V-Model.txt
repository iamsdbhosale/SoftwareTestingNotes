Agile V-Model :
-------------

                Requirements (User Stories)         Acceptance Testing
                         \                                   /
                          \     <--- Iteration --->         /
                   System Design (Sprint Planning)   System Testing
                            \                             /
                             \   <--- Iteration --->     /
                     High-Level Design           Integration Testing
                               \                       /
                                \ <--- Iteration ---> /
                          Low-Level Design         Unit Testing
                                  \                 /
                                   \               /
                                    \   Coding    /
                                     \  (Build)  /
                                      \_________/

Let's tweak the V-Model to reflect an Agile approach, where development and testing happen iteratively and collaboratively.

Term         | Question Answered                | Example
-------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------
Verification | Are we building it right?        | Reviewing requirements, designs, code
Validation   | Are we building the right thing? | Running and testing the software

Term | Role             | Activity                              | Type
-----|------------------|---------------------------------------|------------
QA   | Prevents defects | Process checks, standards enforcement | Verification
QC   | Detects defects  | Actual software testing               | Validation

‚úÖ Quality Assurance (QA) = Verification
QA is process-oriented.
	It ensures that the right processes, standards, and practices are followed during software development.
	It doesn‚Äôt involve actual testing of the product.
	Focus: ‚ÄúAre we building the product right?‚Äù
üîç Example:
	Creating a checklist to ensure all requirements are reviewed.
	Ensuring every sprint includes a code review and documentation check.
---
‚úÖ Quality Control (QC) = Validation (includes Testing)
	QC is product-oriented.
	It focuses on finding defects in the actual product by testing it.
	Focus: ‚ÄúAre we building the right product?‚Äù

üß™ Example:
	Executing test cases.
	Reporting bugs.
	Performing regression testing, UAT, etc.

So yes, in casual conversation, people often say:
"QA is verification, QC is testing."
But in interviews or documentation, it's better to clarify:
QA focuses on process (verification), QC includes testing (validation).
