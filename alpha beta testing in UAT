**Alpha and Beta Testing** are types of **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** done before the final release of the software to the public. Here's a simple explanation:

---

### 🧪 **What is Alpha Testing?**

**Alpha Testing** is done **internally** by the **developers or QA team** at the **developer’s site**.

#### ✅ Key Points:
- Done **before** Beta Testing.
- Performed by **internal employees**.
- Goal: Catch bugs before releasing to real users.
- Simulates real users using white-box & black-box techniques.
- May include multiple testing phases (functional, UI, usability, etc.).

> 🔧 Example: A mobile app is tested in-house by the QA team before sharing with selected users.

### 🧪 **What is Beta Testing?**

**Beta Testing** is done by **real users** (external users) in a **real environment**, usually after Alpha testing.

#### ✅ Key Points:
- Performed at **user’s location** (public or private release).
- Goal: Get feedback on **usability, functionality, performance**.
- Helps identify bugs that may have been missed.
- No control over the testing environment.

> 👥 Example: A company releases a beta version of a game to selected players to gather feedback and bug reports.
